# fractal-tree
grabbed a fractal tree code from youtube

To run this code, you'll need to install Processing and enable the Python Mode. Here are the steps to follow:

Download and install Processing from the official website: https://processing.org/download/

Once installed, open Processing and go to the "Tools" menu and select "Add Tool".

In the "Add Tool" dialog, select "Python Mode" and click "Install".

After installing Python Mode, restart Processing.

Create a new file in Processing and paste the Python code into it.

Save the file with a .pyde extension (e.g. my_sketch.pyde).

Click the "Run" button in the Processing editor to run the sketch.

Alternatively, you can run the sketch from the command line by navigating to the directory containing the .pyde file and running the command processing-java --sketch=<directory> --run. Replace <directory> with the path to the directory containing the .pyde file.
